Hello! I'm a Research Scientist at [Boltzbit Ltd](https://boltzbit.com/), working to positively influence the development of Large Language Models (LLMs).

I completed my PhD thesis _Advances in Optimisation of Model Parameters and Hyperparameters for Neural Networks_ in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/).

I'm interested in the automation and democratisation of machine learning, with a keen desire to steer its deployment in an ethical and socially responsible way. My work to date has examined optimisation methods for neural networks and their hyperparameters, and approaches for reliable, well-founded multi-token prediction in LLMs.

Prior to my PhD, I received the BA and MEng degrees in Engineering from the University of Cambridge, specialising in Information and Computer Engineering. My Part IIB Project _Parallelising Sequential Monte Carlo_ was supervised by [Prof Sumeetpal Singh](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/sumeetpal-singh).
